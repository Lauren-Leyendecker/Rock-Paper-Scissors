# Rock-Paper-Scissors-NEW
This program allows a human to play a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors versus the computer. Because this was an assignment for my intoruduction to programming course, I had to use the given computer player class so the computer's choices are predictable and the program could be graded correctly. This program asks the user for their name; asks the user how many rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors they want to play; and plays that many rounds of the game. For each round of the game, the program asks the user for their move choice, have the computer make a random move choice, prints out each player's move choice, and prints the results of the round. After playing the specified number of rounds, the program displays the number of rounds the user won, the number of rounds the computer won, and the number of rounds that were a draw/tie and declares who the better player was based on the number of wins.
